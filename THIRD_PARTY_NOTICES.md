# Third-Party Notices & Clean-Implementation Record

Open-Yoink 是一个**清洁实现（clean-room implementation）**。我们参考了若干开源项目的**公开可观察行为与架构思路**，但没有复制其源代码、UI 素材或专有实现。本文件记录行为参考来源；如未来引入任何第三方代码或资源，会在此追加其许可证文本与版权归属。

## 第三方代码

应用内包含以下第三方代码：

1. **Sparkle**（自动更新框架，Swift Package Manager 引入，`upToNextMajorVersion: 2.6.0`，实际解析 2.9.6）。Sparkle 以 binary framework 形式链入 app，用于检查更新（GitHub Pages 上的 appcast feed）与安装更新包（GitHub Releases 上的 DMG，EdDSA 签名校验）。
2. **mediaremote-adapter**（供默认关闭、完全本地处理的可选 Now Playing 模块使用）。OpenYoink 固定于上游提交 `e3ff5021eb0875858bd05f48d2e9ba2e962d1cf6`，捆绑其 Perl 适配脚本、从该提交源码构建的通用二进制 `MediaRemoteAdapter.framework` 和 capability probe 客户端。开启 `--allow-missing-title`，缺少标题的有效播放会话显示播放器名称。应用不直接链接私有 MediaRemote 符号；用户未启用媒体模块时不会启动 helper。
